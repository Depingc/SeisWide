This directory and its sub-directories copy the documentation and source codes for Colin Zelt's ray tracing program RayInvr (version 1992; freeware).  The modification to this source code is mainly in the input of velocity model: it now takes v.bin instead of v.in. There is a makefile (myRayinvr.dsw) for this souce code, ready to be compiled by Digital Fortran for Windows 95 or NT. The result of this compilation is an executable file: myRayInvr.exe, which should be put into your program directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\SeisWide3.2) for use by SeisWide.

Note that this RayInvr only computes travel-time curves. If you want to do more things such as amplitude modeling, gravity calculations, please come to my site http://www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/~deping/ again to download them.
